<p>If you want to see some of the code I&rsquo;ve written, check out my <a href="https://github.com/camillewalters">Github profile</a>.</p>
<h2 id="pushoverhttpsgithubcommilanassuiedpushoverremake-go-to-code"><a href="https://github.com/MilanAssuied/PushoverRemake" title="Go to code">Pushover</a></h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m currently working on a modernized version of the popular 90s video game Pushover with a colleague. In this puzzle game, the user plays an ant who needs to rearrange dominos to get them to all fall over. This remake will have a creative mode where the user can build their own levels. It is being written in Unity.</p>
<h2 id="minthttpsgithubcomcamillewaltersmint-plus-plus-go-to-code"><a href="https://github.com/camillewalters/mint-plus-plus" title="Go to code">Mint++</a></h2>
<p>Mint++ is a budget tracker based on Intuit&rsquo;s Mint, a popular budgeting app. This ongoing project adds features that are missing from Mint, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tracking debts that don&rsquo;t exist in an account, such as as family loan;</li>
<li>Adding more information to the budgeting categories, showing what is a subcategory of what;</li>
<li>Changing how rollover balances (a.k.a sinking funds) are displayed in the monthly spending to be more intuitive;</li>
<li>Showing how much of income is going to taxes;</li>
<li>Projections to help with planning</li>
</ul>
<p>Currently, this makes use of MintAPI, which screen scrapes Mint to get account data using Selenium. Mint++ is firstly being developed as a command line application in Python but will include a Web-based UI in the future.</p>
<h2 id="custom-smart-home-system">Custom Smart Home System</h2>
<p>This project aims to use primarily Arduino to create a customized, cost effective smart home, with the goal of being energy efficient and secure. My home doesn&rsquo;t have centralized air conditioning or heating, so I needed to implement this myself. A concept map of this system is seen below:

<p>In the future I would like to use a tool such as Blynk to be able to get information to my phone, or to be able to control the system remotely.</p>
<h2 id="personal-website">Personal Website</h2>
<p>The latest iteration of my personal website (the one you&rsquo;re reading right now!) was created using the Hugo framework.</p>
<h2 id="ideas-without-borders">ideas without borders</h2>
<p>During the second half of my undergrad, I was involved in Engineers Without Borders on their podcast portfolio to create ideas without borders. During this, I was able to deep dive into various social issues in Canada and analyze them from a systems thinking perspective.</p>
