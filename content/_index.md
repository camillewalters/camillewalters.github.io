# hi! i'm camille

Thanks for visiting my website. I'm a Software Engineer at Unity, currently based out of Montreal. I graduated from the University of Waterloo in 2022 with a BASc in Honors Mechatronics Engineering.

My professional interests currently lie at the intersection of game development, 3D visualization and modeling, and mechatronics. 

In my free time I like cooking, baking, swimming, bouldering and doing yoga.
